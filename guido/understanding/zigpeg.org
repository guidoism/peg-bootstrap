This is an attempt to transform the low-level javascript code from
peg.org to Zig. I'd also like to come up with a better organization
and way to run it.

#+name: setup
#+begin_src zig :noweb yes
  const State = packed struct {
    valid: bool = true,
    val: u24, // The offset into the string buffer
    pos: u24, // The position in input
  };
#+end_src


#+name: rule_template
#+begin_src zig :noweb yes
  fn parse_XXX(pos: i32) State {
    

  }
#+end_src
